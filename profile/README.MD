# Sailowtech

Welcome to Sailowtech's GitHub !

Here you will find our repos, ranging from our science instrument's code to utility tools for our association.

At Sailowtech, our goal is to raise awareness through scientific research and supporting frugal, low-tech initiatives
using sustainable sailing to collect data.

Feel free to contact us if you have any question !
